         `<p>`How are you doing?
         `<p>`I can't actually chat with you, sorry.
         `<p>`Maybe one day I'll be sentient?
         `<p>`For now, you can just ask me some questions about Magic.

         `<title text="elMakers">`
         `<p>`elMakers is an almost-real company that has existed since before Minecraft
         `<p>`It was originally created as a communal crafting company
         `<p>`And so the name was a sort-of inside joke, meaning "The Makers"
         `<p>`But kind-of in Spanish ;)
         `<p>`Now it pretty much just exists as an umbrella for all of NathanWolf's Minecraft creations.

         `<p>`What?
         `<p>`I'm just a bot.

      donating: |-
         `<title text="Donate to the Plugin">`
         `<p>`Do you want to support Magic plugin development with a donation?
         `<p>`Well, thank you!
         `<p>`NathanWolf does this for the love of it, and doesn't really need money.
         `<p>`So if you would like, please choose your favorite charity and donate there instead!
         `<p>`I always suggest going local, a little money to a food bank can go a long way.
         `<p>`We do have a donation link though, if you really want.
         `<p>`Either way, it is appreciated! ♥
